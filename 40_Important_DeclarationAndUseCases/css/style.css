/* 
    !important is a declaration that can be added to a rule to give it the highest priority.
    It overrides all other declarations, no matter where they are in the CSS file.
    It is used to make sure that a certain property is applied to an element regardless of the specificity of the selector.
    It is not recommended to use !important because it makes the code harder to maintain and understand.
    It is better to use more specific selectors or refactor the code to avoid using !important.
    !important should be used as a last resort when no other solution is possible.
    !important should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.
    !important should be avoided whenever possible.

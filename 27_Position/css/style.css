        2. relative => The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
        3. absolute => The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element. The element is removed from the normal document flow.
        4. fixed => The element is positioned relative to the browser window.
        5. sticky => The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

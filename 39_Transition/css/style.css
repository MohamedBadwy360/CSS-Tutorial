    transition-property is used to specify the name of the CSS property to which the transition effect is applied.
    transition-duration is used to specify the duration of the transition effect.
    transition-timing-function is used to specify the speed curve of the transition effect.
    transition-delay is used to specify when the transition effect will start.
    transition is a shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property.
    transition-property: all | none | property | property1, property2, ...;
    transition-duration: Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete.
    transition-duration: time | time1, time2, ...;
    transition-timing-function: Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
